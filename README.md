This research repository contains the imputation and analysis code for
the manuscript ‘Een longitudinale studie naar fluctuaties in vertrouwen
gedurende de coronapandemie’ by Erik Snel, Godfried Engbersen, Peter van
der Heijden & Hanne Oberman.

Due to privacy concerns, the data is not available online. The *Data*
folder only contains the conversion codes for the OESCH and ISCO
categorizations of the employment sector variable.

The *Analyses* folder contains the imputation and analysis code and
output. And supporting figures can be found in the *Figures* folder.
